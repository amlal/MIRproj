This is a project for the Fall 2012 Music Information Retrieval Class at NYU.
Project authors: Amar Lal and Kevin Murphy
Goal: Create a Musical Mosaicing system that makes use of spectral centroid, chroma and amplitude information.

To run:

projMain(libraryDir,targetFile,outFile,distVec);
where
libraryDir is the directory for library files (MUST be terminated w/ a slash)
targetFile is the filepath of the target file
outFile is the name of the output file
distVec is an optional vector of weightings for the parameters. In order, 
RMS amplitude, max chroma, max amplitude, chroma, spectral centroid

Files:

AL_CD.m 		Complex domain detection function
AL_EDist.m 		Simple euclidian distance between two vectors
princarg.m 		phase wrap between -pi and pi
projAnalysis.m 		analysis and data storage loop for each file
projMain.m 		main code
			reverse order of events
pvoc.m 			phase vocoder
chromaValues.m		chroma function
spectralCentroid.m	spectral centroid function
